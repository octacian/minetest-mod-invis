This extremely simple mod introduces a single command that allows you to make yourself or another player invisible (both the player itself and the nametag). While you are in vanish mod, a simple text HUD will be shown above the hotbar with a notice that you are currently invisible to other players.

__Usage:__
- `/vanish`: Toggle invisibility for yourself
- `/vanish <name>`: Toggle invisibility for another player

__Note:__ The `/vanish` command requires the `vanish` privilege.
